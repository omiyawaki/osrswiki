Declaring an 'is-' property with a Boolean type has been deprecated. Starting with Gradle 9.0, this property will be ignored by Gradle. The combination of method name and return type is not consistent with Java Bean property rules and will become unsupported in future versions of Groovy. Add a method named 'getCrunchPngs' with the same behavior and mark the old one with @Deprecated, or change the type of 'com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.BuildType$AgpDecorated.isCrunchPngs' (and the setter) to 'boolean'.
